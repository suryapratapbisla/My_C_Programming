# My_C_Programming
This repository contains my journey of learning C programming, covering essential concepts like pointers, arrays, functions, structures, file I/O, and more. Along with solving 80+ problems, Iâ€™ve built projects like Guess the Number and Snake, Water, Gun Game. A perfect blend of learning and hands-on coding!
