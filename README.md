C Programming Journey 🚀
Welcome to my C Programming Repository! 🎉

This repository is a collection of everything I’ve learned and built while mastering the fundamentals of C programming. With guidance from CodeWithHarry, I explored core concepts through hands-on coding, problem-solving, and project building.

🌟 Concepts Covered
Chapters:
1️⃣ Variables, Constants & Keywords
2️⃣ Instructions and Operators
3️⃣ Conditional Instructions
4️⃣ Loop Control Instructions
5️⃣ Functions and Recursion
6️⃣ Pointers
7️⃣ Arrays
8️⃣ Strings
9️⃣ Structures
🔟 File I/O
1️⃣1️⃣ Dynamic Memory Allocation

This structured learning journey ensured that I not only understood the theoretical aspects of C programming but also applied them practically.

🛠 Projects
Guess the Number Game 🎲: A simple game where the program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it.
Snake, Water, Gun Game 🐍💧🔫: A fun variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors implemented in C.

🏆 Practice Problems
Solved 80+ problems to deepen my understanding and improve my coding skills.

❓ Why This Repo?
This repository is more than just a collection of code—it's a roadmap of my C programming journey:

For Learners: If you’re starting out with C, this repo can serve as a guide to understanding key concepts and applying them.

For Me: It’s a personal journal of growth that reflects my progress and motivates me to take on bigger challenges.

🌱 What’s Next?
This repository will continue to grow as I take on more advanced projects and challenges in C. Stay tuned!
