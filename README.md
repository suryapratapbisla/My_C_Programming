C Programming Journey 🚀 <br>
Welcome to my C Programming Repository! 🎉 <br>

This repository is a collection of everything I’ve learned and built while mastering the fundamentals of C programming. With guidance from CodeWithHarry, I explored core concepts through hands-on coding, problem-solving, and project building.

🌟 Concepts Covered <br>
Chapters: <br>
1️⃣ Variables, Constants & Keywords <br>
2️⃣ Instructions and Operators <br>
3️⃣ Conditional Instructions <br>
4️⃣ Loop Control Instructions <br>
5️⃣ Functions and Recursion <br>
6️⃣ Pointers <br>
7️⃣ Arrays <br>
8️⃣ Strings <br>
9️⃣ Structures <br>
🔟 File I/O <br>
1️⃣1️⃣ Dynamic Memory Allocation <br>

This structured learning journey ensured that I not only understood the theoretical aspects of C programming but also applied them practically. <br>

🛠 Projects <br>
Guess the Number Game 🎲: A simple game where the program generates a random number, and the player has to guess it. <br>
Snake, Water, Gun Game 🐍💧🔫: A fun variation of Rock-Paper-Scissors implemented in C.

🏆 Practice Problems <br>
Solved 80+ problems to deepen my understanding and improve my coding skills.

❓ Why This Repo? <br>
This repository is more than just a collection of code—it's a roadmap of my C programming journey:

For Learners: If you’re starting out with C, this repo can serve as a guide to understanding key concepts and applying them.

For Me: It’s a personal journal of growth that reflects my progress and motivates me to take on bigger challenges.

🌱 What’s Next? <br>
This repository will continue to grow as I take on more advanced projects and challenges in C. Stay tuned!
